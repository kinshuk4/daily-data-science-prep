## [Coding] Max Sum Increasing Subsequence: Uber [Medium]

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given a list of positive integers, return the maximum increasing subsequence, that is, the largest increasing subsequence within the array that has the maximum sum. Examples: if the input is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] then return 5 (since no subsequence is increasing), if the input is [3, 2, 5, 7, 6] return 15 = 3 + 5 + 7, etc.

## [Coding] Friendship distance: Facebook [Medium]

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You have the entire social graph of Facebook users, with nodes representing users and edges representing friendships between users. Given the edges of the graph and the number of nodes, write a function to return the smallest number of friendships in-between two users.

For example, if the graph consists of 5 users A, B, C, D, E, and the friendship edges are: (A, B), (A, C), (B, D), (D, E) then the function should return 2 for the input A and E.
