## [Coding] Obstacle Paths: Twitch [Medium]

This problem was asked by Twitch.

You are given an m by n matrix with with 0s and 1s, where a 1 represents an obstacle and a 0 represents no obstacle. Determine the number of ways to navigate from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom right corner given that at any point in time there is only a move down or to the right as long as there is not an obstacle in that spot.

For example, if the matrix is given by: [[0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0]] then you should return 1 since there is exactly one path.

## [Coding] Smallest K Pairs: Apple [Medium]

This problem was asked by Apple.

Given two sorted arrays of positive integers, and an integer k, determine the k smallest pairs among the two arrays, where a pair is defined as having exactly one element from the first array and one element from the second array.

For example, if the k = 3 and the two arrays are [1, 3, 6, 10] and [2, 5, 7, 9] then [[1, 2], [3, 2], [1, 5]] since those are the three smallest pairs.

## [Probability] Hit Show: Netflix [Hard]

This problem was asked by Netflix.

Before a show is released, it is shown to several in-house raters. You assume there are two types of shows: hits, which have an 80% chance of being liked by any viewer, and misses, which have a 20% chance of being liked by any viewer. There is currently a new show which you believe has a prior distribution of 60% being a hit, and 40% being a miss. Given that 8 raters rated the show and 6 of the 8 liked the show, what is the new posterior distribution of being a hit or miss?
